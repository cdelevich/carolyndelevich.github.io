                <h1>about me.</h1>
                <p>I am an ecologist with an interest in the factors that shape tree community composition. This work
                    has taken me all over the world, from the Congo Basin to interior Alaska. It has
                    given me an abundance of opportunities that have shaped me both personally and professionally.</p>
                <p>When I started my PhD in 2021, I was eager to get back in the field. I sought out an advisor with ongoing
                    research in Malaysian Borneo. I was excited for the chance to work in the third and final tropical
                    region, after previously working in the American and African tropics. However, six months into my
                    PhD, my advisor unexpectedly left her job and academia completely. The plan I built for my future went out the
                    window and I had to pivot, fast.</p>
                <p>Until this point, programming and statistics was a means to an end, those final stages of the research
                    process that I struggled through and frankly dreaded. But beyond my goal of getting to Malaysia, I came
                    into my PhD wanting to push myself to become more technically proficient. I already knew how to live abroad
                    in remote places, how to pick up languages quickly to get work done, and how to deal with the physical and
                    mental rigors of field research. But I was clueless as to how chloroform aided in DNA extraction or
                    what 'demultiplexing' was in a sequencing context; nor could I state with complete
                    confidence the meaning of a p-value (a cardinal sin in statistics).</p>
                <p>So I sought out every opportunity to take courses in statistics and programming. I picked up linear algebra
                    on the fly and slowly climbed the learning curve of object-oriented programming. Soon, machine learning
                    was no longer a mystifying scifi term. Python was now my favorite programming language and not those
                    scary things that I swam with in Cameroonian rivers. I was confident in what a p-value was, but
                    also learned that you don't always need them (yay, Bayesian statistics!). Most importantly, I learned
                    about a emerging field called data science, and it clicked. This is what I want to do.</p>
                <p>The trajectory of my career is certainly different than what I imagined three years ago. I went
                    through a brief grieving period over the loss of my adventures in Borneo. But now, I am grateful that
                    unexpected circumstances brought me down this new career path. I might not use my field skills in any
                    obvious sense, but I definitely see them come through. Because I expect the unexpected, I pivoted
                    quickly to an entirely different career. Because I'm used to limited resources, I know how to hunt
                    down free online courses and am a pro at self-guided learning. Because I am adapted to discomfort, I am
                    not afraid to try something new and fail repeatedly until I get it right.</p>
                <p>I now know that my sense of adventure does not need to be tied to my career. It is apart of who I am.
                    It is this sense of adventure that made me unafraid to switch out of a career I had been pursuing for
                    over a decade. And it's this sense of adventure that will still one day lead me to Borneo, but this
                    time, just for the fun of it.</p>
